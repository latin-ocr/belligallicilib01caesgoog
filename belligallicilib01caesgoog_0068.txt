1. THE INHABITANTS OF GAUL.

On the three chief peoples whom Caesar names as occu-
pying Gaul, the Celts or Gauls seem to have been the
principal representatives of the great Celtic racc, which
had in earlier times occupied much of Germany and Aus-
tria, and even of Asia Minor, as well as Franco, Belgium,
and at least part of England. The Galatians of the New
Testament were a branch of thorace, and among modern
peoples, the Scotch‚ Irish, and Welsh are of essentially Cel-
tic origin, as well as the French. The Belgians were also
primarily Celtic, but had become mixed with the German
race sofar as to have a sort of racial individuality of their
own. The Aquitanians belonged, not to the Celtic, but to
the Iberian rece, whose chief representatives at Caesar's
time occupied Spain.

Of most of the different tribes of Gauls mentioned in this
first book of the Gallio War comparatively little is known
beyond what Caesar tells us, but it tends tc keep them dis-
tinct in the mind if one remembers the following facts
about them:-
