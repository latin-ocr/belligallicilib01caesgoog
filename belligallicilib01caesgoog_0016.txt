BELLI GALLIOI

LIBER PRIMUS

Ι. GALLIA est omnis divisa in partes tres3 quarum
, unam incolunt Belgae, aliam Aquitani, tertiam qui
. ipsorum lingua Celtae, nostra Galli appellantur. Hi
j omnes lingua, institutis, legibus inter se differunt.
i Gallos ab Aquitanis Garumna flumen,a Belgis Mas
.· , trbna et Sequana dividit. Horum omnium fortis·

1. Gallia. Caesar uses this name here in a narrower sense

i than that which we are in the habit of giving to the term

i “ Gaul.’' He is writing of the country as the scene of his cam·

paigns, and therefore leaves out of consideration the Roman

ἱ province (afterwards called Gallia Narbonensis) and that part

oi the Italian peninsula known as Gallia Cisalpina. This

ἵ latter, indeed, was already coming to be regarded as a portion
of Italy. cf. ch. Χ.

2. aliam. The slight difference between the use of eliam

, here' and that of altera in Oh ΙΙ. (page 9,line 10) may be

illustrated in English by two sentences like the following :-

; “ George received one book, Jack another, and James the
f third;'' and “ Georgo received one book, Jaclr tte second, and

ἰ dames thethird.’'
Ι 2, 3. Belgae, Aquitani, celtae. For a brief account of

l these peoples, see Appendix 1.

Ι 6. dividit. For the number of the verb, see A.& S. ³20

, (1);A.&G.205‚f; G.285,2;H.463,3.

ject oi differunt in the second line above, inueheap‘tng oven use
