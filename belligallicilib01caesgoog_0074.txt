Omonas. In Caesar’s army each legion was commanded
by a legatus, or by some other officer whom Caesar put in
command for the time being. A quaestoris so spoken
of in Book Ι. Ch. LII. The legati were not appointed os
commandere of special troops, butas assistente t'o the oom-
manding general. Caesar had ten legati, eo that, ae in the
first year of the Gallio War he had bnt six legions, some ’
of his legati must have served in other capacities thau as
commandere of legions. Sometimes, as in the winter quar-
ters, a legatus had more than one legion under his com-
mand. Eaeh general had one quaestor, who was properly
the treasurer of the army, but was sometimes also employed
ae a commender. Eacb legion had also six military tri-
bunes (tribuni militum). Before Caesar 'made the legati
commandere of the separate legions as euch, the tribunes
had taken turns in commanding their legions, but after that
their position lost its importance. Eacb century was led by
a centurion (centurio), so that each legion had sixty cen-
turione. The centurione were eoldiere who had been pro-
moted from the ranke by the commander of the army, but
how they were ranked among themselves ie not known, ex-
cept that those of the first line so called (centuriones
primi ordinis) made a sort of higher class by themselves.
There was also a class of assistant centurione called opti-
6neS, who were either choeen by the centurione themselves
or appointed by the tribuni militum. ’ '

SrANnAane. The chief standard of the legion was the
eagle (aquila), carried by an aquilifer. This standard
consisted of a {eilver (occasionally even a gold) engle, with ⁹
spread winge, and sometimes grasping thunderbolts in its
clawe; it was fixed upon the end of a wooden staff. Eacb
maniplo had a standard oi its own, called a assummum&

usually represented some animal, and was sanet *ss 1·
signiter.
