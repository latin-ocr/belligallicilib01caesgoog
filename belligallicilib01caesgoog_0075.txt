alingers (funditbres) and bowmen (sagittarii). They
were either enlisted from the subject-allice or hired from

“ independent foreign nations. They were combined into
cohorts, and their commanding officers (called praerecti)
were generally Romans.

ΤΗΕΙ cavetur also consisted of foreigners, and was dis·

classes of troops were exempt from guard-duty and from

and extensive engineering operatione, of which we read in
the Gallie War‚ seem to have been performed by the regu-
