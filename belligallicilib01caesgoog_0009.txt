iv PREFA OE

portant, or, like the penultimate of proper names,
are vexatious to look up but dangerous to neglect,
’ Ihave thoright it wisc to mark in the text.

Several matters that seemed too large for treat-
ment in footnotes, and yet essential to the un-
derstanding of Caesar’s work, I have put into an
Appendix. Such are the organisation of the
Roman army, and certain geographical and bio-
graphical details in regard to tribes or individuals
mentioned in the text. If I have gone into
biography at apparently unnecessary length, it is
because Roman names, through the similarity of
their endings, seem to me especially hard for the
pupil to individualize.

The text is that of H. Meusel, Berlin, 1894,
with some changes in the punctuation to bring it
into harmony with tho principles ol English punc-
tuation, and with the relegation to the scot-notes
ol the passages which Meusel regards (justly, it
seems to me, in every case) as interpolatione.

’ Among the various works from which I have
derived assistance Ι am especially indebted to
tho editions of Caesar by Kraner-Dittenberger,
Hinzpeter, and Allen dc Greenough3 to the ac·
count of the Roman army by Rndolf Schneider,
attached to Meusel's School Edition of Caesar 3 and
to Pauly's Real-Encycloplidie der classischen Alter·
