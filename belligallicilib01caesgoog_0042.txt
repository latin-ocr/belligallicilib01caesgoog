' XXVIH. Quod ubi Caesar resciit, quorum por

’ fines ierant, his uti conquirerent et reducerent, si ,
sibi purgati esse vellent, imperavit3 reductos in
hostium numelo habuit; reliquos omnes obsidibus
armis, perfugis traditis in deditionem accepit. Hel· 5
retice, Tulingos, LatobrIgos in fines suos, unde erant
profecti, reverti iussit, et quod omnibus frugibus
amissis domi nihil erat, quo famem tolerarent, Allo-
hrbgibus imperavit, ut iis frumenti copiam iacerent3
ipsos oppida vicosque, quos incenderant, restituere ιο
iussit. Id ea maxime ratione fecit, quod noluit eum
locum, unde Helvetii discesserant, vacare, ne prop
ter bonitatem agrorum Germani, qui trans Rhenum
incolunt, (ex) suis finibus in Helvetiorum fines trans-
irent et finitimi Galliae provinciae Allobrbgibusquc 1⁵
essent. Boios petentibus Haeduis, quod egregia vir·
tute erant cogniti, ut in finibus suis conlocarent,

4. habuit Ι. e. had them killed.

6. For some resson the Rauraci, who are named with the
others in Ch. V, are not accounted for here. They could not
hsve been all destroyed, for they appear later as living in the ·
neighborhood of the modern Btle in Switzerland.

8. tolerarent. Ι. e. by removiug it. This sort of overcharged
construction, by which more is implied than the words used
express when taken separately, is very commonia Latin, and
is one of the things that make the ability to understand the
langusge without translating so valuable.

15. Allobrogibus. For some account of this people, see Ap·
pendis l. They had been added to the Roman province but
recently, and therefore it was especially undesirsble to have
warlike and independent foreign tribes settle next to them.

18. postea. Tbey arc described in Book Vll, Cha IX. and
X, as still dependent on the Haedui, and they probably became
independent as a reward for their faithful seruies in the aar
