' 24 BELLI GALLIOI

tratus. Hos seditiosa atque improba oratione mul-
titudinem deterrere, ne frumentum conferant quod
debeant: praestare, si iam principatum Galliae
obtinere non possint, Gallorum quam Romanorum
simperia perferre, neque dubitare debere, quin, si
Helvetios superaverint Romani, una cum reliqua
Gallia Haeduis libertatem sint erepturi. Ab isdem
nostra consilia quaeque in castris gerantur hostibus
enuntiari3 hos a se coerceri non posse. Quinetiam
rc quod necessariam rem coactus Caesari enuntiarit,
intellegere sess, quanto id cum periculo iecerit, et oh

XVIII. Caesar hac oratione ,Lisci Dumnbrlgem,
Diviciaci fratrem, designari sentiebat, sed quod plu-

16. Concilium (from the same root as clamare) is a body ot
persons called together to listen to propositions and then vote,
without taking an active part in the discussion3 consssium
(from same root as consulere) is a body of persons who delib-
erate upon measures, discuss, and then advise or decide upon
them, It should be said, however, that this distinction was not
always rigorously observed by the Roman writers.

19. esse. Caesar felt, before investigating them, that the
statements made by Liscus were true; therefore, alter investiga·
tion, he says, “he muns that they arc true.” lf he had under-
, taken to investigate without any notion one way or the other
but merely to discover the nuth, he would have said vera esse,
“(zinds that) they are truc.''
