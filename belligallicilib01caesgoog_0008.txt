PREFAOE

Tffls little volume containing the first book oi an
edition ot the Gallio War is based upon the idea
that ability to read Caesar is retarded rather than
aided when the pupil’s attention is constantly di·
verted by notes on technicalities, and by grammati-
cal references. I believe that a less minute know-
ledge oi formal grammar than is commonly supposed
to be necessary will enable an average pupil to read
Caesar with fair appreciation.

In pursuance oi this idea I have reduced gram·
matical notes and references to the minimum, and
have disregarded, as not helping the pupil to a
better understanding oi the situation immediately
at hand, many matters which are generally dwelt
upon. For instance, it seems to me that a mis-
translation or misoonception of a classical passage
is seldom caused bytho reader’s inability to olus-
sa'fy' a subjunctive with cum or with ut, if he knows
the meaning of the verb and notices its ten'se 3 or
by inability to label an ablative as “oi means ''
or “of specification,” ii he recognizes the form as
ablativa at all and can connect it with the words
with which it belongs. ’

Certain cases oi quantity, which, like ablatives

of the first deolension, are olten syntaot'mchhy 'xm-
