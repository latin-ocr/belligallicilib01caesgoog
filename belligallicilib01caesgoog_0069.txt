Bon (or 1301). A large and powerful tribe, oi which those
mentioned here were but a small part, that joined the Hel·

request oi the Haeduans, to settle in their territory. Caesar
says they came from beyond the Rhine, and there had been

the country now called (from their name) Bohemia. An-

northern Italy, and had had many bloody collisione with the
Romans until their subjugation in 191 Β. c. and subsequent

joined the invasion of Gaul and Italy by the Cimbri and

Teutoni, and the Tigurini under Divico during that time
(107 Β. c.) destroyed the Roman army under L. Cassius
